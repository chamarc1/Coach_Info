# Coach Info Website

This is a Flask website for my coaching team. The website provides information about our team, such as our history, current members, and upcoming events.

## Getting Started

To get started with the website, you'll need to have Python and Flask installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Flask using pip:

`pip install flask`
After installing Flask, you can run the website by executing the following command in the terminal:

`flask run`
This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the website by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the website, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Any contributions, such as bug fixes or new features, are greatly appreciated.
